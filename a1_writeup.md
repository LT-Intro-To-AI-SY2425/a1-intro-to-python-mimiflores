# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I haven't worked with python in a long time, so I hadn't realized until now how different it is than Java. 
I like it much better and I especially like the "pythonic" way of doing things because it saves time
and is more efficent in my opinion. 


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
I really like not having to do semicolons at the end of every line, and even though the proper indentation still applies, I feel like
there is a more shorthand version for everything which makes it much easier to work with. 


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
In my AI problems, I tried to do some intermediate problems since I hadn't worked with python in a long time and I especially wanted to 
focus on questions similar to those we might have done in CSA with Java to see the differences in each. I think once I keep practicing
I will get used to doing things in the "pythonic" way.
